	\brief Allows immediate mode drawing to a CPU buffer, rather than a buffer object.

	It is frequently useful to do immediate-mode style drawing to a CPU buffer. One might be doing
	old-style client-side array rendering, or just compiling lots of data to eventually be
	uploaded to actual buffer objects.

	This class does this. It stores the attribute data into a `std::vector<char>`, in accord with the
	given VertexFormat.

	Unlike glmesh::Draw, this class does not require you to provide a maximum upper limit on the number
	of vertices ahead of time. And because this class does not do any rendering,
	it also does not require you to provide a primitive type. So you can write as many vertices as you want.
	It will still throw if you attempt to extract the vertex data when a vertex is only partially specified,
	but otherwise, there are no limitations.

	You can extract the data by copying it into a `vector<char>`, by "moving" it into one, or by
	directly uploading it to a buffer object.
