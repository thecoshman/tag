	\brief RAII-style class for immediate-mode type rendering through a VertexFormat and StreamBuffer.

	The constructor of this class is given an OpenGL primitive type and the number of vertices to use.
	You must then call one of the Attrib member functions for each vertex and for each attribute
	in the VertexFormat. The order of attributes within a vertex corresponds to the order of
	attributes in the VertexFormat.

	The VertexWriter::Attrib specialization must match the type of the attribute from the VertexFormat
	\em exactly. The number of components however does not have to match.

	Successfully constructing an object of this type will affect the following OpenGL state (note: none
	of this state will be touched in the event of an exception in the constructor):

	- The current `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` binding.
	- If VAOs are available, the current VAO will be affected. The current VAO after this object is
	destroyed will be VAO 0. The VAO used to render will be the communal one stored in the StreamBuffer.
	- If VAOs are not available, the current attribute array state will be modified as
	VertexFormat::Enable does. Note that you should make sure that all attributes are disabled
	*before* constructing this object. Otherwise, badness can result.

	\note Do \em not attempt to change buffer binding state during the lifetime of any instance of
	this class. Also, do not attempt to create two of these objects at the same time.

	The VertexWriter::Attrib functions, used to write attributes, will also throw
	TooManyVerticesSentException if more vertices have been sent than were originally specified.

	\note This class cannot be copied.
