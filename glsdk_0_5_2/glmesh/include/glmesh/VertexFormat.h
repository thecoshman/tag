	/**
	\brief Describes the layout for a sequence of vertex attributes, to be used for rendering.

	VertexFormat creates an interleaved layout, where each attribute is interleaved with each
	other. The attributes always have 4 byte alignment, as there are some hardware that
	really doesn't like misaligned data. Double-precision attributes have 8-byte alignment.

	The byte offset of each attribute from the beginning of the vertex can be queried. This is
	useful if all of the attributes come from the same buffer object's source.

	Note that the order of the attribute sequence is the same as the order of the AttributeList.
	This means that the order is \em not the order of the OpenGL attribute location. The attribute
	sequence order, as defined by the AttributeList, is the order the attributes will be stored in
	within the buffer object.

	Any function that takes an \a attribIx parameter is taking an index into the attribute sequence
	order, *not* an OpenGL attribute location.

	You may use VertexFormat::Enable to perform all of the \c glEnableVertexAttribArray
	and \c glVertexAttrib*Pointer calls to associate a buffer object with this format.
	It is a RAII class, so the destructor will call \c glDisableVertexAttribArray to
	disable the arrays.

	This class uses value semantics and is copyable.

		\brief RAII-style class for binding a VertexFormat to the OpenGL context.
		
		The constructors of this class call VertexFormat::BindAttributes or
		VertexFormat::BindAttribFormat, as appropriate. The destructor
		calls VertexFormat::DisableAttributes.
		
		This class can
		[use the ARB_vertex_attrib_binding functionality](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Separate_attribute_format)
		instead of `glVertexAttribPointer`. If you do, then this class
		only changes the vertex format state, not the buffer binding state. That is, it will call
		`glEnable/DisableVertexAttrbiArray` and [`glVertexAttribFormat`](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glVertexAttribFormat),
		but not `glVertexAttribBinding`,
		`glBindVertexBuffer`, or `glVertexBindingDivisor`.

		Note that all of the attributes will still have the same stride, and the offsets will be computed
		as though it all comes from a single buffer. You can use multiple separate VertexFormat objects
		if you want to have different buffers with different attributes for the same mesh.
		
		If you are not using ARB_vertex_attrib_binding, then this class assumes that
		all vertex data comes from the buffer currently bound to `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER`.

		The constructors have the effect of calling VertexFormat::BindAttributes or
		VertexFormat::BindAttributeFormats, as appropriate. Those functions define the
		OpenGL state that will be changed. The destructor will call VertexFormat::DisableAttributes.

		Assuming all of your buffer setup is in order (ie: if you're using separate attribute formats,
		you [have bound a buffer](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glBindVertexBuffer)
		and [set the attribute binding](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glVertexAttribBinding)),
		you can [use any OpenGL rendering functions](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Vertex_Rendering)
		to render using the VertexFormat given.
