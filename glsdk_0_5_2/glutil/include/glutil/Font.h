	/**
	\brief Creates a font with the given size and characteristics.

	This function requires an active OpenGL context.
	
	This function allocates the Font object with new. You are responsible for deleting the Font object
	yourself with delete. Also, make sure that the OpenGL context is still active; it must be the same context
	(or one shared with it) that was active when this function was called.

	Since the Font creates an OpenGL texture, calling this function will modify the following OpenGL state:

	\li [All `GL_UNPACK_*` state](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Pixel_Transfer#Pixel_transfer_parameters).
	\li The current texture unit's `GL_TEXTURE_2D` target will have texture object 0 bound to it.

	If ARB_texture_storage, or GL 4.2+, is available, then the [texture's storage will be
	immutable](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Texture_Storage#Immutable_storage). So don't
	count on being able to modify the storage (the contents can be modified, just not the
	storage structure itself).

	Calling this function multiple times with the same parameters will create multiple copies
	of the same data. That is not necessary; just keep the Font object around and use it from
	different places.

	\param eSize The requested font size.
	\return The created Font.

	\note Despite this function creating a texture, this function has no dependencies on
	[GL Image](@ref module_glimg).

	positions and texture coordinates are 2D vectors.

	\brief The class that represents a series of glyphs as well as the information to layout a string of text.

	This class contains functions to get the rendering information for a single glyph and a line of glyphs. It
	also has functions for inspecting properties of the font (the height of lines, width of the characters, etc).

	This font will always be fixed-width. It contains characters only from the first 256 Unicode codepoints.
	Characters outside of this range are not available.

	This font is a "bitmap" font; the glyphs are stores as images in a texture.

	This class's constructors are private; you must use glutil::GenerateFont to create an instance of this class. The
	destructor is not private; you can (and \em should) call delete on this pointer.

	This class contains and manages an OpenGL texture. This means that deleting this class will destroy that texture.
	Most important of all, you must ensure that this object does not outlive the OpenGL context that was active when
	glutil::GenerateFont was called.

	All layout functions of this class assume the standard OpenGL coordinate system: +Y goes up and +X right.
	If you want to have a top-down coordinate system, you will need to adjust the glyphs manually.
